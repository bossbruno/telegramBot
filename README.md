# telegramBot
A simple script to give commands to my telegram bot and show a particular tweet  #learning
To customise this code to your bot all you need to do is
find this line application = Application.builder().token("put your bot token here").build()
and put in your bot token in the inverted commas
Thats all you need, the functions are customisable too
